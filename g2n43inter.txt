Dear Disciple, 
Interpretation of Heraclitus Fragment from Lecture 43 of Grade 2. 
In Lecture No.43 of Grade 2, we asked you to send us your interpretation of the following paragraph from the Fragments of Heraclitus. 
"This Word (Logos) is everlasting, but men are unable to comprehend it before they have heard it or even after they have heard it the first time. Although everything happens in accordance with this Word, they behave like inexperienced men whenever they make trial of words and deeds such as I declare, as I analyse each thing according to its nature and show what it is. But other men have no idea what they are doing when awake, just as they forget what they do when they are asleep. 
As you will see from our set answer below, the essence of the 'secret' message lies toward the end of this fragment...and is short and sweet...as all these things should be! 
H.M. 
Heraclitus 
The real meaning here is that when people go to sleep, they wake up in actuality, whilst the so-called 'waking life' on earth is but a dream. When people awake from this waking dream (whilst their bodies lie asleep here), they often do not remember much about the earthly existence which seems so very important to us all. And when they 'awake' (as they think they do) after the sleep of the body, they can seldom remember what they themselves have experienced whilst away from the sleeping body.
